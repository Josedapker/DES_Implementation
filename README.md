Implementation of DES by Jose Jaramillo and Marco Rojas
This is a Python code that implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which is a symmetric-key block cipher used to encrypt and decrypt data. The code consists of two functions: generate_keys() and encrypt().

The generate_keys() function is used to generate 16 round keys used in the DES algorithm. The input to this function is the original encryption key, which is a 64-bit string, and the output is a list of 16 48-bit round keys. The key generation process involves permuting the original key using the PC-1 and PC-2 tables, dividing the permuted key into two halves, and then rotating and permuting the halves to generate the 16 round keys.

The encrypt() function takes the plain text to be encrypted and the round keys as inputs and outputs the encrypted text. The encryption process involves permuting the plain text using the initial permutation table (IP table), dividing the permuted text into two halves, and then performing 16 rounds of substitution and permutation using the round keys generated by the generate_keys() function. Finally, the encrypted text is permuted using the inverse of the IP table to generate the final cipher text.

To set up this code, one would need to have Python installed on their system. They would then need to copy the code into a Python file, save the file, and run it. The input to the generate_keys() and encrypt() functions would need to be specified based on the data to be encrypted. The code could also be modified to allow for user input of the encryption key and plain text to be encrypted.
